Finding zero of a function.
First two lines of text file are the boundary within algorithm works, next lines are factors of the next powers of "x".

Algorithm gets values of start, center and end of the function and then calculates where the zero is placed, then boundary of the function is shrinked into half and the whole process repeats to the point where approximation (known as epsilon) is smaller than difference between start and end of the boundary. Algorithm does work only if function has only one zero but it is not limited to linear functions.
